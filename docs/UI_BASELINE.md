## Builder View tab dissolved; Mesh tab scoped to Inspect/Results

The Builder panel's **View** tab is gone, split three ways by asking what each control
actually was:

- **View state** (representation topology/simulation/detail, superimpose, side-by-side,
  port overlay, recentre) was never panel content — it is seven commands. They now live
  in `buildActions.ts` + `commands.ts` and surface under **View ▸ Builder**. Menus have
  no pressed styling, so `ACTIONS` gained `checked`/`checkedTitle`: the title renders as
  `✓ Topology` when the state is on. Without that a menu of toggles gives no feedback at
  all about which one is active.
- **The two compile-output toggles** (`buildSim`, `buildDetail`) moved into BuildTab's
  Compile settings. They were mis-filed: they control what the compiler *emits*, not
  what you *look at*.
- `ViewTab.tsx` was deleted and de-registered.

The Scene panel's **Mesh** tab is now mode-scoped. `TAB_META` gained an optional `modes`
field and `tabsForMode` applies it alongside the existing contextual gate. Mesh quality
asks whether a discretisation is good enough to trust — Inspect and Results work. In
Build you are authoring the geometry the mesh will later be made *from*, so there is
nothing to assess yet.

**The `?worker&inline` barrier again, fifth time.** The new `sceneTabs.test.ts` imported
the rule from `SceneBody`, which reaches a store, which reaches the model worker, which
only a bundler resolves. Same `does not provide an export named 'default'` as every
previous occurrence. Fix is always the same: extract the pure rule to `src/shell/`
(`sceneTabs.ts`), have the component re-export it. Assume any rule worth testing must
start life outside a component.

## Files header aligned with the dock panels

The Files header's buttons were hand-rolled at `min-h-[40px] min-w-[40px]` with 24px
icons, sitting one column away from Model and Outliner whose headers use `IconButton
size="sm"` at 22px. The mismatch was visible side by side. They now use the same
`IconButton`/`Icon size="sm"`.

**Maximize was replaced by Close.** Maximize made sense when Storage was a floating panel
over the 3D view. As a resizable column with a splitter it is redundant — you widen it by
dragging — and it made Files the one panel whose header offered no way to put it away.
Removing the button made the whole `maximized` machinery dead (nothing could set it
true), so the state, its Escape handler, the fixed-overlay styling branch and the
body-portaled scrim went with it: ~40 lines.

Two things had keyed off `maximized` as a proxy for "wide": the Modified column and the
list's fill behaviour. The column now keys off the panel's real width
(`useFilesPanel.width >= 420`) — it is a space question, and the user answers it by
dragging the splitter, rather than by entering a mode that no longer exists.
